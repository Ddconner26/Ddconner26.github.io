# Avengers Data Analysis
This project analyzes the Avengers dataset from FiveThirtyEight to explore questions like:
- How many Earth-616 heroes are full-time or honorary Avengers?
- How many of them are female?
- How many times have they died in the comics?
- How many original Avengers are still active?

The full cleaned dataset, analysis, and plots can be found [here](github.com/Ddconner26/Avengers-analysis).
